# 🌐 Infrastructure Automation Project 🚀

## 📖 Overview

Welcome to the **Infrastructure Automation Project**! This repository contains a complete Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline leveraging **Jenkins** and **Docker**. The goal of this project is to **streamline application deployment**, improve **reliability**, and create an automated workflow that simplifies infrastructure management. 

---

## 📋 Features

✨ **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automates the build, test, and deployment process using Jenkins.  
🐳 **Docker Integration:** Containerizes the application for consistent environments across development, testing, and production.  
📦 **Docker Compose:** Simplifies local development and multi-container applications.  
🛠️ **Custom Scripts:** Includes helper scripts for automation and cleanup tasks.  
📂 **Modular Design:** Organized file structure for scalability and maintainability.
